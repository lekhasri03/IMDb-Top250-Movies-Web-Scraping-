This project Implemented uUsing BeautifulSoup / Requests (or Scrapy, depending on your implementation), the project automates the process of collecting data and exporting it into a structured format (CSV/Excel). The dataset can then be used for data analysis, visualization, or machine learning tasks.

-> Features

Scraped movie details including title, release year, rating, votes, and genre.

Exported the data into CSV/Excel for further analysis.

Performed basic data cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent values.

Created visualizations (bar charts, histograms, word clouds) to highlight insights like:

Top-rated movies

Distribution of genres

Ratings vs. release years

-> Tech Stack

Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / Colab for implementation and analysis

->  Project Goals

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how web scraping + data analysis can be applied to extract useful insights from publicly available web data. This project highlights skills in data collection, cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis.
